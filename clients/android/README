This is the Android client for the TvRecorder. Currently, it supports a user
interface that allows recording new jobs at a specific time and channel. Later
releases will add support for listing queued jobs and a EPG that allows easier
job creation.
The necessary settings can be defined via user interface (push the menu button
and choose `settings`). Necessary settings in this release are the url to the
TvRecorder server and its port.

NOTE: This application needs access to the internet.

The TvRecorder has been developed using Android 2.2 API Version 8. The
TvRecorder has not been tested in former Android releases.


Library Dependencies:
=====================
  * Android 2.2 API Version 8
  * tvrecorder-common 0.1-SNAPSHOT


Installation:
=============
The installation is based on the tools shipped with the Android SDK and the Ant
build tool (see http://ant.apache.org for more details about the Ant build tool).

  * Compile the sources with:
    > ant compile

  * Create a test package for your Android plattform:
    > ant debug
    This will create a file ``bin/tvrecorder-debug.apk`` that is ready to
    install it on your Android plattform.

  * Install the binary on your Android plattform connected via USB:
    > $ANDROID_SDK_DIR/platform-tools/adb install

    Replace $ANDROID_SDK_DIR with your local Android installation.


Running:
========
Choose the application in your menu. The initial start will lead you to the
preference user interface, because the TvRecorder needs to know the URL of your
TvRecorder server and its port. After you have finished the configuration you
can step back to the TvRecorder UI with the back button. You should retrieve a
list of supported channels by your server. If not, restart the application and
try it again - make sure that your device is connected to the internet.
