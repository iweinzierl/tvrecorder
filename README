Welcome to TvRecorder!

The TvRecorder is a client/server application that allows users to record tv
programs via using a DVB-(C|S|T) receiver. Therefore, TvRecorder makes use of
third party software, currently MPlayer, to store DVB streams to hard disk.
The server behaves as a REST service and serves different methods. Clients can
use these services to query status information or start new record jobs.
