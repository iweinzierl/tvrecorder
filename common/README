The common package supports interface, objects and helper classes used by
clients and server.


Library Dependencies:
====================
  * JUnit 3.8.1
  * Restlet 2.0 SNAPSHOT
  * Restlet-xml 2.0 SNAPSHOT

Note: the dependencies can be downloaded using the Maven build tool that is the
prefered way to build this package.


Installation:
=============
The installation is based on the Maven build tool (see http://maven.apache.org
for details).

To compile the sources, just type the following:
  > mvn compile

To build a JAR archive, type:
  > mvn package
The resulting JAR is placed in the ``target`` directory.

Or make it available for your local maven installation with the following
command (this is recommended, because the server can load this dependency from
local filesystem then):
  > mvn install
