	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/TvRecorder.java: The
	  TvRecorder Activity has now an OptionsMenu with two items - the target of
	  "Quit" is to stop the application, "Settings" should open a window to
	  change some basic settings (like the server url). "Settings" is not
	  implemented yet!

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/listeners/RecordJobListener.java:
	  Now, we make sure, that the start date is smaller than the end date of the
	  record job. Otherwise, an warn dialog is shown and no job is sent to the
	  server.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/RecordServerResource.java:
	  Removed a debug line that has been commited by accident.

2010-12-25  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo@intevation.de>

	* common/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/common/objects/Job.java: The
	  job stores its start and end time as Date objects now, because there have
	  been problems while serialization or deserialization in client or server.
	  The result was, that no job could be transfered between client and server.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/RecordServerResource.java:
	  Added some more debug statements and validate the job objects at the
	  beginning of add() to make sure, that it is not null.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/AddJobForm.java:
	  This form's getChannel() method returns a real Channel object instead of
	  a string representation of the Channel.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/listeners/RecordJobListener.java:
	  Some adjustments based on the changes mentioned above.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/DatePickerDialog.java,
	  clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/TimePickerDialog.java:
	  New. Dialogs to select a date and a time. Both contain a special interface
	  that describes a method that is fired if a date or a time was selected in
	  the widget.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/DateTimeWidget.java:
	  Removed the onTouch event and added two OnClickListener to the date and
	  time fields. A click on the date field will open a DatePickerDialog, a
	  click on the time field will open a TimePickerDialog.

	* common/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/common/rest/ChannelsResource.java,
	  common/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/common/rest/RecordResource.java:
	  Added the resource path to the interfaces.

	* clients/android/res/values/config.xml: A configuration file where
	  necessary settings shuould be defined. Currently, important things are
	  remote server url and server port.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/Config.java: New. This
	  class defines some functions that retrieve application settings.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/TvRecorder.java:
	  Removed the path definitions for the ChannelsResource and RecordResource.
	  The definitions are useless now: the relative pathes are defined in the
	  interfaces and the server url is retrievable by Config.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/handlers/RetrieveChannelsHandler.java,
	  clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/listeners/RecordJobListener.java:
	  The necessary urls are taken from Config now.

	  The initial checkin of an Android client. Currently, the gui consists of a
	  single AddJobForm. This form contains two DateTimeWidgets to adjust the
	  start and end time, a select box to select the channel, a text field to
	  specify a name of the job and a button to add the defined job.

	  Note: The creation of a new job is currently not implemented.
