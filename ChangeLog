2011-01-07  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo@intevation.de>

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/XMLUtils.java:
	  Introduced a helper class to work with XML documents.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/config/Config.java:
	  Introduced this class as a central point for querying configuration
	  settings.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/backend/DBConnection.java:
	  The path to the database file is queried from Config now. If no path is
	  configured, or an error occured while reading that config option, the
	  default path is used (tvrecorder.db).

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/TvRecorderServer.java:
	  The port that the server is listening on is read from Config now. If no
	  port is configured, or an error occured while reading that option, the
	  default port (8282) is used.

	* server/conf/config.xml: A default config file. It contains the port that
	  the server should listen on, the path to the sqlite database file and the
	  path to the channels configuration file.

2011-01-06  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo@intevation.de>

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/FileUtils.java:
	  Added a new function that retrieves the lines of a file as String array.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/DVBSChannelsParser.java:
	  This class represents a parser that is used to extract the channels of a
	  MPlayer DVB-S configuration file.

2011-01-06  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo@intevation.de>

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/RecordServerResource.java: 
	  After a job has arrived here, a new At job is created. This job executes a
	  command (currently for MPlayer) that starts recording the job.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/ChannelsServerResource.java:
	  Changed the keys of the channels.

	* server/contrib/stop_records.sh: The default shell script that is executed
	  by At jobs to stop MPlayer recording.

	* server/jobs/do-not-delete-me,
	  server/records/do-not-delete-me: Directories for storing jobs and records.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/AtJobCreator.java,
	  server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/StartAtJobCreator.java,
	  server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/StopAtJobCreator.java:
	  An abstract base class and two subclasses. AtJobCreators have the task to
	  create new At jobs. StartAtJobCreator should be used to create an At job
	  to start recording, the StopAtJobCreator should be used to stop these
	  recordings.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/CmdProducer.java.
	  server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/MPlayerCmdProducer.java:
	  The CmdProducer interface describes a single method to create command
	  lines. MPlayerCmdProducer produces a concrete command line that that
	  starts recording with usage of Mplayer.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/utils/FileUtils.java:
	  A helper class for working with files.

2011-01-05  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo@intevation.de>

	* common/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/common/utils/DateUtils.java:
	  A helper class that should make it easier to work with Date objects.

2011-01-03  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo_weinzierl@web.de>

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/RestApp.java: The
	  backend is available via the Context's attribute map now ('backend').

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/TvRecorderServer.java:
	  Injected the Backend into the RestApp.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/RecordServerResource.java:
	  Incoming jobs are saved to database now. But the real recording stuff is
	  still missing!

2011-01-03  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo_weinzierl@web.de>

	* server/pom.xml: Added a dependency to Xerial's SQLiteJDBC
	  driver (version 3.7.2).

	* server/docs/schema.sql: A simple schema definition for the job table.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/backend/Backend.java:
	  The backend. Currently, there are two methods defined to load all jobs
	  from database and insert new jobs into it.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/backend/DBConnection.java:
	  This class is used to retrieve a database connection.

2010-12-27  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo_weinzierl@web.de>

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/TvRecorder.java: The
	  TvRecorder Activity has now an OptionsMenu with two items - the target of
	  "Quit" is to stop the application, "Settings" should open a window to
	  change some basic settings (like the server url). "Settings" is not
	  implemented yet!

2010-12-25  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo_weinzierl@web.de>

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/listeners/RecordJobListener.java:
	  Now, we make sure, that the start date is smaller than the end date of the
	  record job. Otherwise, an warn dialog is shown and no job is sent to the
	  server.

2010-12-25  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo_weinzierl@web.de>

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/RecordServerResource.java:
	  Removed a debug line that has been commited by accident.

2010-12-25  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo@intevation.de>

	* common/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/common/objects/Job.java: The
	  job stores its start and end time as Date objects now, because there have
	  been problems while serialization or deserialization in client or server.
	  The result was, that no job could be transfered between client and server.

	* server/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/server/rest/RecordServerResource.java:
	  Added some more debug statements and validate the job objects at the
	  beginning of add() to make sure, that it is not null.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/AddJobForm.java:
	  This form's getChannel() method returns a real Channel object instead of
	  a string representation of the Channel.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/listeners/RecordJobListener.java:
	  Some adjustments based on the changes mentioned above.

2010-12-11  Ingo Weinzierl <ingo_weinzierl@web.de>

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/DatePickerDialog.java,
	  clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/TimePickerDialog.java:
	  New. Dialogs to select a date and a time. Both contain a special interface
	  that describes a method that is fired if a date or a time was selected in
	  the widget.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/ui/DateTimeWidget.java:
	  Removed the onTouch event and added two OnClickListener to the date and
	  time fields. A click on the date field will open a DatePickerDialog, a
	  click on the time field will open a TimePickerDialog.

	* common/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/common/rest/ChannelsResource.java,
	  common/src/main/java/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/common/rest/RecordResource.java:
	  Added the resource path to the interfaces.

	* clients/android/res/values/config.xml: A configuration file where
	  necessary settings shuould be defined. Currently, important things are
	  remote server url and server port.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/Config.java: New. This
	  class defines some functions that retrieve application settings.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/TvRecorder.java:
	  Removed the path definitions for the ChannelsResource and RecordResource.
	  The definitions are useless now: the relative pathes are defined in the
	  interfaces and the server url is retrievable by Config.

	* clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/handlers/RetrieveChannelsHandler.java,
	  clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/listeners/RecordJobListener.java:
	  The necessary urls are taken from Config now.

	  clients/android/src/de/inselhome/tvrecorder/client/utils/DateUtils.java:
	  The initial checkin of an Android client. Currently, the gui consists of a
	  single AddJobForm. This form contains two DateTimeWidgets to adjust the
	  start and end time, a select box to select the channel, a text field to
	  specify a name of the job and a button to add the defined job.

	  Note: The creation of a new job is currently not implemented.
